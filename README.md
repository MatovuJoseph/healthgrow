# HealthGrow
HealthGrow - Is a health based android tool built during the MadiroHacks Hackathon solving problems faced by Healthy Entrepreneurs during provision of health products and services in rural areas.

## Problem and Challenges being addressed
### Problem
> No Digital Registration of Consumers and Sale Information
### Challenges
> 1. Low smart phone skills of Community Healthy Entrepreneurs
> 2. Spoffy Internet Connectivity
> 3. Not Seeing the Benefit of Digital Registration
> 4. Many Local languages in Multiple Countries

## Proposed Solution

> 2. Setting a Consumer loyalty program where already registered ones have scannable physical cards which provide user data to easy CHE work
> 3. Capturing GPS location of CHEs at the moment of Selling
> 4. Setting up a Community rewarding program to accelerate adaption of the tool by CHEs

## How HealthGrow Works to Address Each Problem/Challenge
