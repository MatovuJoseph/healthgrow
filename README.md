# HealthGrow
HealthGrow - Is a health based android tool built during the MadiroHacks Hackathon solving problems faced by Healthy Entrepreneurs during provision of health products and services in rural areas.

## Problem and Challenges being addressed
### Problem
> No Digital Registration of Consumers and Sale Information
### Challenges
> 1. Low smart phone skills of Community Healthy Entrepreneurs (CHEs)
> 2. Spoffy Internet Connectivity
> 3. Not Seeing the Benefit of Digital Registration
> 4. Many Local languages in Multiple Countries

## Proposed Solution
> 1. Coming up with an extremely Easy-to-Use tool to enabe CHEs to register customers and sales information
> 2. Setting a Consumer loyalty program where already registered ones have scannable physical cards which provide user data to easy CHE work
> 3. Capturing GPS location of CHEs at the moment of Selling
> 4. Setting up a Community rewarding program to accelerate adaption of the tool by CHEs

## How HealthGrow Works to Address Each Problem/Challenge
> 1. This tool is built to support multiple countries in different country local languages. All to be managed and controlled from a Centralized Database.
> 2. This tool also is to support offline usage during data registration through Android Room Database and then sync data to server when online. In addition to this, 
> A USSD application is to be developed to enable CHE's without internet connection to submit data from the HealthGrowApp Data Forms via  USSD Code Sequence. eg
> \*785\*1\*customername\*gender\*dob\*district\*village\*phonenumber#
> 3. This Tool also enables CHEs track their Rewarded points and rewards over time
> 4. This Application is to be accompaned with a web administrative dashboards with access rights basing on the Different HE (Healthy Entrepreneurs) countries.
